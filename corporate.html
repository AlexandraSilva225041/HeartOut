          <ul>
            <li>
              A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website)
              <em>&mdash; see the example below from the BUas brand book:</em>
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #1E1E1E;"></span>
                  #1E1E1E
                  <em>Black is the first thing that comes to mind when we think of Hard Rock. It represents the darkness, intense feelings, extremes, and aesthetic value of the music genre. It's edgy and even scary. #1E1E1E is a slightly lighter black, making it easier to contrast.</em>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #2e0038;"></span>
                  #2E0038
                  <em>Dark Purple goes along side the black on this one, as it is a powerful color frequently used in album covers and other rock artwork. It is dynamic and slightly unexpected.</em>
                </li>
                <br> 
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #AE0909;"></span>
                  #AE0909
                  <em>The main value of HeartOut is Passion, and that is what this burning red represents. It is also heavily used in rock artwork.</em>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #49662c;"></span>
                  #49662C
                  <em>Looking at album covers and different artworks, hard rock can be quite colourful. It was decided to add this dim green, symbolizing safety, nature, humanity.</em>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FF8000;"></span>
                  #FF8000
                  <em>This saturated yellow brings some contrast to the color scheme, differentiating it. It is also a great symbol of power, Energy and Community.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            <br>
            <li>Font choices</li>
            <h3>Medieval Sharp - Header Font</h3>
            <p>Medieval Sharp is a, as the name says, sharp and powerful font. It embodies some curves while keeping its energy and harshness. It is still 
              readable. Various hard rock artoworks, such as album covers, include similar, medieval style fonts. This typeface is suitable for headers 
              as it calls attention and adds personality to the brand.</p>
             <br> 
            <p>Roboto Regular - Body Type</p>
            <p>Roboto is a simple and readable typeface. Since the website has a dark background, which makes it more difficult to create contrast, as well as a considerable amount of text and detail, readability is very important. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Justification of Navigation and UI patterns</h3>
            <p>In the Home Page, the visitor gets an understanding of what they can do on the website, in other words, of the product, and what is the meaning of their actions. The power they hold by being able to help other people by 
              writing a review, as well as checking other reviews. The second one is more encouraged (through a button) since it is a smoother way to engage witht the community at first. Since the beginning, it should be obvious for the 
              visitor that HeartOut is not like most online community where people can share their interest, but rather a place where they can be helpful for each other, which connects to the USP. The containers help separate the copy 
              in the page and the video-replayer makes sit more dynamic.  (PUT VALUES IN THE COPY OF THIS PAGE)</p>
              <br>
              <p>In the About Us page, the actual values of the brand are stated, and a better explanation of the brand, rather than product. It is more about the main idea of HeartOut. The separation of the product and brand has the 
                intention of intensifying the idea of each one, instead of mixing them. The product may be the reviews website, but the brand is about the community and helping each other. There is also an introduction to the concept 
                development team, bringing the visitors closer to the where the concept came from. It includes pictures of the members since, according to research, hard rock fans like face to face interactions and enjoy closeness. 
                This page uses simple containers. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The reviews are in a whole separate page, as it makes sense for them to be all together in one place. The cards create contrast between each event. By clicking the review the visitor can see it more in detail on 
                  a separate page, which helps focusing on one event at a time. Columns are used in the reviews part of the website, since it was the best way to divide the categories and the stars reviews while being aligned. Hard rock 
                  fans are often interested in specific artist or venues, so they can view the specific review categories only on those events. The button “Write Review” leads to a separate page where the visitor can focus only on this.</p>
                  <br> 
                  <p>According to the research conducted, hard rock fans do not like to chat online, and the communication works more on the basis of word of mouth. That is why this rating system works. They do not have to text or comment, 
                  but have that possibility. This way they are sure that the event they intent on going will match their expectations.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The category ratings such as Performance, Vibes, Safety, Offline and Hard Hard Rock connect with the brand values of Passion, Loyalty, Safety, and Feeling Present in the Moment. Research showed that hard rock fans tend 
                    to not be on their phones during concerts and care a lot about the loud music while keeping its quality.</p>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>After the multiple problem interviews we did as a team, we created a persona. From these outcomes, we found the category need of the target 
            audience is people who want to share their passion with others. With these we created brand awareness, a platform called Heart Out, which is not 
            just an overview of all events in one place but be able to find events that fit someone's value in a quick overview for reviewing. There are no 
            obligations to interact with others but still possible. We based the values of the event review on insights from the problem interviews. What became 
            part of our brand attitude are passion, loyalty, safety, and feeling in the moment. To be unique as a brand we strive from passion and have the ability 
            to feel present in the moment, while still providing safety and security.  With Heart Out we want to create a passionate community for hard rock fans of 
            all ages who share the same values.</p>
            <br>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>Are communication objective is based on the population of Noord Brabant and rock and alternative music listeners in Noord Brabant, according to our interview 
            insights rock fans don’t usually follow much content on social media and do not engage or participate frequently with their music genre, therefore our goal 
            is to raise engagement by a 1000 people with a response of interact on our social media page and share with word of mouth. Our media tactics are via 
            Facebook and Instagram. We track our objective by comparing the views of a post and the likes. 
            <br>
            We first started with still single images that communicate our values and vision of Heart Out. We noticed we didn’t get much engagement in general therefore 
            we posted a moving visual ´reel´ on Instagram and Facebook. After posting this went from an average of 21 views to 60 views on Instagram, in the statics 
            that could be in the appendix there is a clear after-effect of posting the reel. To keep track of our objective we compare the number of views and likes. 
            Although more people saw our reel on Instagram, as expected, they didn´t seek further interaction by liking the post. However, on Facebook we applied the 
            same method there noticed the view stayed stable, didn’t change much and therefore didn’t have much effect. </p>
            <br>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>In our communication planning is our biggest learning point not using the same strategy on two different platforms.  We solve this by posting more frequently 
            and different kinds of posts so there is more variety. Since we are a profit-making company, we start to work with sponsorship to increase the revenue stream 
            and create a bigger awareness among the target audience. The objective is mention to raise awareness by word of mouth despite being difficult to track it is 
            an important factor for our target audience. We will be focusing more on offline marketing, therefore hanging posters in local pubs, bars and pop stages. 
            In this way, we with Heart Out trying to be closer to our main goal to share our passion for hard rock music with others.</p>

			  <ul><li>Giel has 1.1 million followers on instagram 17251 average likes so 17251 : 1 1000 000 = 0.01568273 engagement from his followers so a 1.57% engagement rate. With an influencer calculator we found that the estimated earning are $2,332 - $3,498 which would be with one post. It is recommended to post 3-5 times per week. So 2,332 x 3 times a week x 52 weeks a year = 363.792 euros at least in 12 months </li>
			  </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
            <li>List your main costs: define the fixed and variable costs.</li>
  <li>Calculate the cost per unit.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Marketing plan is 15-20.000 euro, ours is not as big so on the lower end will be 15.000 thousand euros.</li>
			<li>Brand promotion 1 post from an influencer with campaign is 3000-9000 euro. If we use Giel de Winter that would probably be the high end so 9000 euro costs. An influencer like Giel de Winter has a large variety of followers in the Netherlands and also in the music industry therefore would be a good fit to promote our brand and get people to view and use our website. With this whether 1 or 1000 people engage and come to our site after this does not matter for the cost as we pay for his one campaign promotion regardless.</li>
			<li>Content managing on webistes in 2024 costs $10.000-49.000. As we do not have options regarding photos and videos and tthe main part of reviews are by clicking stars and in our interviews we found that the hard rockers are kind and happy people we believe we can be on the lower end of moderating, so about $15.000</li>
			<li>As our target group is noord-brabant we do not expect high traffic on the site at the same time, therefore we can do shared website hosting. This costs between $2.51 and $4.62 per month so $55,44 yearly max.</li>
		  <li>Marketeers in the netherlands make 4-7k a month so 4x12=48k. Developer make 62.500 euro per year. There is 3 of us all doing all 3 of the roles therefore this would be 48+62.5x3=331,5k salary costs.</li>
		  <li>Our fixed costs are: Marketing plan, paying the influencer, salaries, and hosting. These are the same every month/year.</li>
			<li>Our variable costs we do not have.</li>
        </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>State what your product and/or service is and how this contributes to your unique value proposition.</li>
			  <ul>
