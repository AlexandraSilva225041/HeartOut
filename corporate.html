                  #1E1E1E
                  <em>Black is the first thing that comes to mind when we think of Hard Rock. It represents the darkness, intense feelings, extremes, and aesthetic value of the music genre. It's edgy and even scary. #1E1E1E is a slightly lighter black, making it easier to contrast.</em>

                  <em>Dark Purple goes along side the black on this one, as it is a powerful color frequently used in album covers and other rock artwork. It is dynamic and slightly unexpected.</em>

            <li>Font choices</li>
            <h3>Medieval Sharp - Header Font</h3>
            <p>Medieval Sharp is a, as the name says, sharp and powerful font. It embodies some curves while keeping its energy and harshness. It is still 
              readable. Various hard rock artoworks, such as album covers, include similar, medieval style fonts. This typeface is suitable for headers 
              as it calls attention and adds personality to the brand.</p>
             <br> 
            <p>Roboto Regular - Body Type</p>
            <p>Roboto is a simple and readable typeface. Since the website has a dark background, which makes it more difficult to create contrast, as well as a considerable amount of text and detail, readability is very important. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Justification of Navigation and UI patterns</h3>
            <p>In the Home Page, the visitor gets an understanding of what they can do on the website, in other words, of the product, and what is the meaning of their actions. The power they hold by being able to help other people by 
              writing a review, as well as checking other reviews. The second one is more encouraged (through a button) since it is a smoother way to engage witht the community at first. Since the beginning, it should be obvious for the 
              visitor that HeartOut is not like most online community where people can share their interest, but rather a place where they can be helpful for each other, which connects to the USP. The containers help separate the copy 
              in the page and the video-replayer makes sit more dynamic.  (PUT VALUES IN THE COPY OF THIS PAGE)</p>
              <br>
              <p>In the About Us page, the actual values of the brand are stated, and a better explanation of the brand, rather than product. It is more about the main idea of HeartOut. The separation of the product and brand has the 
                intention of intensifying the idea of each one, instead of mixing them. The product may be the reviews website, but the brand is about the community and helping each other. There is also an introduction to the concept 
                development team, bringing the visitors closer to the where the concept came from. It includes pictures of the members since, according to research, hard rock fans like face to face interactions and enjoy closeness. 
                This page uses simple containers. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The reviews are in a whole separate page, as it makes sense for them to be all together in one place. The cards create contrast between each event. By clicking the review the visitor can see it more in detail on 
                  a separate page, which helps focusing on one event at a time. Columns are used in the reviews part of the website, since it was the best way to divide the categories and the stars reviews while being aligned. Hard rock 
                  fans are often interested in specific artist or venues, so they can view the specific review categories only on those events. The button “Write Review” leads to a separate page where the visitor can focus only on this.</p>
                  <br> 
                  <p>According to the research conducted, hard rock fans do not like to chat online, and the communication works more on the basis of word of mouth. That is why this rating system works. They do not have to text or comment, 
                  but have that possibility. This way they are sure that the event they intent on going will match their expectations.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The category ratings such as Performance, Vibes, Safety, Offline and Hard Hard Rock connect with the brand values of Passion, Loyalty, Safety, and Feeling Present in the Moment. Research showed that hard rock fans tend 
                    to not be on their phones during concerts and care a lot about the loud music while keeping its quality.</p>

				<ul><li>The important factors of the test were focused on navigating through the website and the look and feel of the brand. We do this to confirm that vision and values come across well by our users. From the result, we can make improvements in our mobile and laptop versions of the website. </li>
				  <li>For the testing, we used four participants. We split the participants, and with two participants we focused on the mobile version of the website. For the other two, we focused on the laptop version in this way we can test in multiple ways the accessibility of the website. We ask the participants the following questions: 
						  <li>Read one of the reviews?</li>
					  <li>Submit a review.</li>
					  <li>Do you feel like the values of the are portrayed on the website?</li>
					  <li>How do you feel about the colors?</li>
					  <li>How does navigation make you feel?</li>
					  <li>Are there any other improvements?</li>
				  </li>
					<li>The overall opinion was positive, the participants found it easy to navigate and were satisfied with the constituency of the website in the mobile and laptop versions. However, a participant from the laptop group was distracted by the moving visual behind the review button therefore he was not sure where to click. In the mobile group, the participant found the website readable however the review page, the reviews were too big as a result he only saw one review per scroll. He suggested making them smaller so it is more of an overview look. There were different opinions about the values some agreed some were not.</li>
					<li>From these outcomes, we can improve the website by working on experiencing are vision and values on the website and making navigating through the website even easier.</li>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>

On the website, users can find, read, and write reviews of past concerts or events, making it easier for them to choose venues, bands, and facilitate their overall experience. HeartOut makes sure that the hard rock fans under their wing match absolutely the vibe of the event they are attending. This brand supports passion and feeling in the moment, as well as loyalty for bands and assuring safety in different experiences. Hard Rock fans are there for each other, and we are there for them.</p>

It is to hype/build up for the upcoming website but also a platform that keeps being alive, attracting and inspiring new followers all the time.</p>
            <br>
          <h5>Communication and Media Plan</h5>
          <h6>Target Audience</h6>
          <p>Demographic and Geographic 
          
            Age – All ages; 5-95 years old (age is not a relevant point, people of all ages attend concerts, families go together many times) 
            
            Nationality – Dutch and European internationals (more likely to be into the same bands and have an idea of the venues) 
            
            Region – Noord Brabant, Netherlands 
           
            Other – Somehow, hard rock helped them go through a difficult moment, for example, blow off steam during a phase of behavioural issues 
          
            Psycographic 
          
            Personal relations – close to family, especially parents. Common to have a shared family interest in hard rock. Tight friend group. 
          
            Personality - Strongly prefer face-to-face communication rather than online. Prefer to have structure, plans need to be predictable. Dislike feeling out of place. Caring people to those around them. Cheerful and positive. Usually reserved people. 
            Values – Cares about feeling like they belong to the environment, the “vibes” need to match with them. This applies not only to hard rock events but also anything in their lives. They care about enjoying an event or experience in peace, so the feeling of safety and security is important. They also believe that people should live more in the moment, and not succumb to routine. Experience strong emotions is a form of self-expression and of connecting to people. 
            Need – A (geographically) close online community where they can connect and feel closer to the people by meeting them in concerts; Somehow predicting the vibe of the concert and if it fits them  
            Solution to the need – a place to share valuable feedback in order to make an informed decision about going or not to a concert, in an uptight community that values the same categories 
          
            Behavioural 
          
            Social media habits – Follows accounts related to hard rock, like fan-pages or official bands, but does not interact with them, however it is enough to keep them informed of events. Also does not chat with friends online much.  
          
            The persona developed with this information can be viewed in the appendix, through this link.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Decision Making Process</h6>
            <p>To go to a concert, the decision is taken by the individual, usually months before, rarely last minute, around friends or family 

              The website might be used between friends, as they get to know it exists by word of mouth when they are together. The “vibe match” promise triggers them to use the website, and also curiosity since this type of online community is not common between hard rock fans</p>
              <br>
              <h6>Positioning</h6>
              <p>HeartOut aims to grow a now underdeveloped online community, focused on the target audience segment that likes socializing and uses face-to-face communication. As mentioned in the decision making process, hard rock fans tend to feel more encouraged to take action in a physical group setting. Considering these two factors, it makes sense to understand where they meet physically. According to the interviews conducted, hard rock fans usually meet up with their friends at bars, where there are posters and flyers about upcoming events. 
                HeartOut could spread posters feauturing the app around bars, with for example a monthly overview of events and brand review for one of the venues, for example. In this case, both the overview of events and review system are added benefits compared to competitors around.  
                Hard rock fans also make use of the internet, not to interact among each other, but as a way to access information. On websites such as TicketMaster, TripAdvisor, and Locaties, an overview of events or venues can be found easily. On social media, hard rock fans often follow several pages with content about bands, the bands themselves, venues, and festivals.
                HeartOut is no different than competitors in that sense. However, once again, HeartOut offers the benefit of a non-biased, outside identity that has the added benefit of reviewing events through several categories.

                <h6>Media Tactics</h6>
                <p>The platforms used were Instagram and Facebook. The communication plan explaining why can be seen in the appendix or through this link.
                  The promotional activities developed on these platforms involved posts, stories, and reels. These can be seen below under Professionalism. 
                  The content calendar can viewed in the appendix, through this link. The content calendar was updated over time according to the success of previous content shared. It was also meant for the audience to share the overall message of the campaign with their friends through word of mouth. More details on the activities can be seen in Learning Points.
                </p>
                <br>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>We learned from our interviews that hard rock fans are not highly active on social media and interacting online with one and other. We set our goal to raise engagement by a 1000 people and wanted the response to be sharing word of mouth with their friends and to react with ahre. <br>
		We quickly noticed when posting on social media we had somewhat of a reach but those we reached tended to not engage. We switched our tactic and posted a moving visual ´reel´ on Instagram and Facebook. After posting this we went from an average of 21 views to 60 views on Instagram. While we did expect an increase in views a surprising finding was that the reel did not get more likes than on some of our images. This could mean that the increase in views in the real could come from a broader audience by instagram algorithm boosting a reel with a trend. This would mean the target audience themselves tends to interact with images more than reels for us. <br>
		The post with the famous‘ ‘angry music for happy people’-august burns red ‘ got most of the likes confirming one of our findings from the beginning that the hard rock fans prefer to engage with the specific content , bands, music, sayings they like and agree with rather than just images of hard rock. Lastly, our post about our values got the same amount of likes. We created our brand values based on the target audience’s values. We found out in our interviews that their values mean a lot to them and therefore them engaging with values they stand for was less surprising too. Any of our posts with jut a hard rock or brand image got less engagement. <br>
		We can conclude from this that our target audience really seeks their values and loyal artist or bands in the content they engage with and that simply hard rock images do not interest them enough to engage with even when it reaches them. This means that for our future we should put deep thought and meaning behind every post made. Read for more details about this in our future planning below. <br>
		Finally we realised during our project that we put more effort into instagram than facebook. This resulted in us having barely any likes at all on facebook. We should have divided the tactics for them better. </p>
            <br>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>In our communication planning, our biggest learning point is not using the same strategy on two different platforms.  We solve this by posting more frequently and diverse kinds of posts, so there is more variety. From our learning points we notify that are most liked post is something recognisable. For future post, we will create more of those kinds of posts. Since we are a profit-making company, we start to work with sponsorship to increase the revenue stream and create a bigger awareness among our target audience. In this way we can collaborate with other brands, therefore also use them on social media what will create a different variety of social media posts. In objective it is mentioned to raise awareness by word of mouth despite being difficult to track it is a key factor for our target audience. We will be focusing more on offline marketing, therefore hanging posters in local pubs, bars, and pop stages. In this way, Heart Out is trying to be closer to our main goal to share our passion for hard rock music with others. </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
List your sources of revenue: describe the revenue model and the (different) revenue stream(s).
      <li>Giel has 1.1 million followers on instagram 17251 average likes so 17251 : 1 1000 000 = 0.01568273 engagement from his followers so a 1.57% engagement rate. With an influencer calculator we found that the estimated earning are $2,332 - $3,498 which would be with one post. It is recommended to post 3-5 times per week. So 2,332 x 3 times a week x 52 weeks a year = 363.792 euros at least in 12 months </li>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
            <li>List your main costs: define the fixed and variable costs.</li>
  Calculate the cost per unit.
			<li>Marketing plan is 15-20.000 euro, ours is not as big so on the lower end will be 15.000 thousand euros.</li>
			<li>Brand promotion 1 post from an influencer with campaign is 3000 - 9000 euro. If we use Giel de Winter that would probably be the high end so 9000 euro costs. An influencer like Giel de Winter has a large variety of followers in the Netherlands and also in the music industry therefore would be a good fit to promote our brand and get people to view and use our website. With this whether 1 or 1000 people engage and come to our site after this does not matter for the cost as we pay for his one campaign promotion regardless.</li>
			<li>Content managing on webistes in 2024 costs $10.000-49.000. As we do not have options regarding photos and videos and tthe main part of reviews are by clicking stars and in our interviews we found that the hard rockers are kind and happy people we believe we can be on the lower end of moderating, so about $15.000</li>
			<li>As our target group is noord-brabant we do not expect high traffic on the site at the same time, therefore we can do shared website hosting. This costs between $2.51 and $4.62 per month so $55,44 yearly max.</li>
		  <li>Marketeers in the netherlands make 4-7k a month so 4x12=48k. Developer make 62.500 euro per year. There is 3 of us all doing all 3 of the roles therefore this would be 48+62.5x3=331,5k salary costs.</li>
		  <li>Our fixed costs are: Marketing plan, paying the influencer, salaries, and hosting. These are the same every month/year.</li>
			<li>Our variable costs we do not have.</li>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
            State what your product and/or service is and how this contributes to your unique value proposition.
				  <li>Our product is a website which offers a place to view and post reviews which are based on feelings. This in order to quickly find events that fit what you value. Reviews are about vibes, feeling of safety, feeling of off or online vibes and much more. It contributes to the unique value proposition as with our website you don't get the feeling of having to interact but it is all about having the option to do how you feel like in the moment. </li>
			
            Clarify the fit between the product/service developed and the brand identity/brand image.
				  <li>Our brand is all about passion, loyalty, safety and feeling in the moment. Our site allows you to get a quick overview of events based on feelings. You are able to follow your hard rock passion based on what you value such as having offline vibes to feel in the moment, feel safe, general vibes and more. We encourage interaction being optionall by having a variety of options as just reading reviews, posting by a simmple few clicks or adding writing to your review. We promote sharing passions by placing reviews or interacting in discussions.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
		<li>Before starting this project none of the team members were familiar with the hard rock community or the genre itself. Therefore we all were very biased about the stereotype, so it surprised us how many people listen to hard rock music as a result they didn´t fit in the stereotype. Another assumption that we had, is how big the community is, among friends and in bars for that reason word of mouth is a strong factor. We all accepted the average age of hard rock listeners was 50+, however our interviewees mentioned multiple times how all ages come together at a concert. At least they were all very passionate when they started talking about their music every interviewee could not stop. </li>
